I have added folders for each S.O.L.I.D principle, along with examples in JavaScript, so that one can understand each principle by differentiating the issue from the resolution.

**S** --> Single Responsibility Principle<br/>
**(Ex. validateAndCreateUser => validateRequest & createUser)**

**O** --> Open Closed Principle<br/>
**(Ex. roles based checkRole => addRole)**

**L** --> Liskov Substitution Principle<br/>
**(Ex. Bird, Sparrow, Pengiun => Bird, FlyingBird, Sparrow, Pengiun)**

**I** --> Interface Segregation Principle<br/>
**(Ex. Worker, Developer, Tester => Coder[Developer], Tester[QAEngineer], Manager[ProjectManager] )**

**D** --> Dependency Inversion Principle<br/>
**(Ex. MySQLDatabase, DataFetcher => Database, MySQLDatabase, MongoDBDatabase, DataFetcher)**

**Note: The examples I have provided alongside each principle are meant to serve as reminders to help you recall the explanations.**
