I have added folders for each S.O.L.I.D principle, along with examples in JavaScript, so that one can understand each principle by differentiating the issue from the resolution.

*S* --> Single Responsibility Principle 
(Ex. validateAndCreateUser --> validateRequest & createUser)

*O* --> Open Closed Principle 
(Ex. roles based checkRole  --> addRole)

*L* --> Liskov Substitution Principle 
(Ex. Bird, Sparrow, Pengiun --> Bird, FlyingBird, Sparrow, Pengiun)

*I* --> Interface Segregation Principle 
(Ex. Worker, Developer, Tester --> Coder=>[Developer], Tester=>[QAEngineer], Manager=>[ProjectManager] )

*D* --> Dependency Inversion Principle 
(Ex. MySQLDatabase, DataFetcher --> Database, MySQLDatabase, MongoDBDatabase, DataFetcher)

**Note: The examples I have provided alongside each principle are meant to serve as reminders to help you recall the explanations.**
